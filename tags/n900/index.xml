      <description>As you know, MeeGo 1.1 Development Release(Nightly build) has been released. I saved some log files on my N900 when it was booted by microSD.
I used in the following files.
meego-handset-armv7l-n900-nokia-proprietary-1.0.90.1.20100831.1-mmcblk0p.raw.bz2
meego-handset-armv7l-n900-nokia-proprietary-1.0.90.1.20100831.1-vmlinuz-2.6.35.3-5.2-n900
You can get this image from http://tablets-dev.nokia.com/meego-codedrop.php on which you need your N900 product ID.
BTW, N900 image can display the Handset UX. Also rotation can be worked.

      <description>Yesteaday, LInuxCon Japan was published session schedule by The Linux Foundation
http://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/linuxcon-japan/schedule
Actually, I posted CFP(Call For Partitipation). Making a presentation in English, That&amp;rsquo;s one of the my goal. I got a chance:)
My session is &amp;ldquo;Porting MeeGo to another devices&amp;rdquo;. MeeGo is supported Netbooks, Nokia N900 smartphone now. MeeGo is released arm and x86 binaries.This is an opportunity that can use and support many devices. I&amp;rsquo;m sure we can do it.</description>

      <description>As you know, MeeGo 1.0 has been released. Netbook has the User Experience then you can test that using image on your netbook. But N900 and IVI image has no UX. They seem to be development release in position :(
I have a time now, so I output dmesg on my N900 when it was booted by microSD and temporaly boot of kernel.
I used in the following files.
meego-n900-open-armv7l-1.0.0.20100525.1-sda.raw.bz2 ( bzcat xxx.</description>

      <description>As you know, MeeGo codes has been opened on the end of March. You can get ia32/arm RPMS/SRPMS now. http://repo.meego.com
But currently User eXperience doesn&amp;rsquo;t published. MeeGo community promised to release at Stard of April. And then, The promise was carried out :-) But we can only boot up and see console screen. There were some opinion to this activity on MeeGo mailing list. For example, &amp;ldquo;User interface has not been released.</description>
